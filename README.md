# Web Component Demo

- built using web components with custom elements (supported by latest Chrome)
- the component is built with the similar idea as React, with one render function to construct the DOM structure
- a simple global state is used, similar idea as Redux (with react-redux)

## How to run

- `yarn` to start
- to run in production mode, `yarn prod` will run all the required steps to build and start the server, JS/CSS minified with sourcemap

## Suggestions

- build Virtual DOM like React
